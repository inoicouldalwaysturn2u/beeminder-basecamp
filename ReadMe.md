## Intro

Goal is to have multiple app or own data going into Beeminder.com for tracking, motivation, and a [quantified self] look at data in one location.

This repo for now will only deal with Basecamp data being pushed to Beeminder goals. First, want data on to-dos like completed ones for certain projects pushed to Beeminder goals. So track number of todos by day.

--

Another repo will deal with HarvestApp.com time tracking being pushed to Beeminder goals.

So some overlap of code between the repos. When things are more settled, might combine repos or something.

**Maybe**
- Asana to-dos
- Trello to-dos
